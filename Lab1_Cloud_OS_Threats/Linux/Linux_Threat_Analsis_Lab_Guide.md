Great! Based on your background—**Intermediate Linux**, **Advanced GCP/Azure**, **Intermediate AWS**, and **Advanced Terraform**—we can streamline our approach to emphasize Linux OS internals and threat analysis tasks without spending too much time on the fundamentals of cloud provisioning. However, we’ll still cover cloud-specific nuances to ensure you’re fully prepared for the environment-based interview questions at Palo Alto Networks and Meta.

## Phase 1: Cloud Lab Setup and Foundational Knowledge

### 1. Cloud Environment Setup on GCP
Since you’re advanced in GCP, let’s use it to host our Linux lab. We’ll take advantage of GCP’s straightforward VM provisioning and its security controls.

**Action Steps**  
1. **Create a new GCP project** (if you don’t already have a sandbox project):
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a project named something like “linux-threat-lab.”
2. **Enable compute services** (Compute Engine) for that project.
3. **Spin up a VM instance** (Ubuntu or Debian):
   - Choose a small machine type (e.g., e2-medium) for cost efficiency.
   - Enable the default firewall rules to allow SSH (or use IAP for secure SSH).
   - Attach a service account with appropriate permissions (usually default editor or a custom role with minimal privileges).
4. **Access your VM** via SSH from the Cloud Console or your local terminal (using gcloud CLI).

**Tip:** Since you have advanced Terraform skills, you could optionally define this setup in code (Terraform) to practice your IaC approach. This is also a valuable skill to highlight during interviews, demonstrating robust, repeatable infrastructure provisioning.

**What You’ll Learn / Review**  
- GCP IAM roles, basic networking (VPCs, subnets, firewall rules).  
- Secure SSH setup and basic OS initialization.

### 2. Linux Internals Overview
Even though you have intermediate Linux experience, we want to reinforce key internals:

1. **Filesystems & Permissions**  
   - Review how `ext4`, `xfs`, or other common filesystems are structured.  
   - Practice `ls -l`, `chmod`, `chown`, and `umask`.

2. **Process Management & Scheduling**  
   - Understand `init` vs. `systemd` (common in Ubuntu/Debian).
   - Commands like `ps`, `top`, `htop`, `kill`, `nice`, `renice`.
   - Real-world analogy: Think of processes like workers in a factory. `systemd` is the supervisor deciding who works when and how much CPU time they get.

3. **Memory & Storage Internals**  
   - High-level overview of how Linux handles memory paging/swapping.
   - Practice commands like `free -h`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, and `df -h`.

4. **Networking**  
   - Socket vs. port basics, `netstat` / `ss`, `iptables` / `ufw`.
   - Real-world analogy: If your VM is your “house,” ports are the “doors” that can be opened/closed using firewall rules.

**Action Steps**  
- **Quick Exercises**  
  - Create two user accounts, each with different permission sets. Practice switching users, changing permissions, and exploring the filesystem from each user’s perspective.  
  - Use `ps -aux` or `top` to monitor running processes. Identify the parent processes (`PPID`) and child processes.  
  - Compare memory usage before and after installing a small service (e.g., `sudo apt-get install apache2`).

**Resources**  
- [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/) – Excellent free resource for brushing up on Linux basics and internals.  
- [Red Hat Linux Documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/) – While RHEL-based, it has great explanations of processes, memory, and filesystem concepts.

### 3. Initial Feedback & Check-In
- **Strengths**:  
  - Your advanced cloud skills mean you’ll quickly set up the environment and have minimal trouble with network or IAM configurations.  
  - Your IaC knowledge (Terraform) is a bonus: you can show interviewers how you script everything for consistency, which is valued at both Palo Alto and Meta.

- **Areas to Focus**:  
  - Deep dive on Linux internals: scheduling, memory management, OS security layers (AppArmor/SELinux, kernel modules). This knowledge is crucial for advanced threat analysis tasks.  
  - Brush up on Linux networking commands (`ss`, `tcpdump`), as these will be very relevant when we move into host-based threat detection.

## Next Steps
- **Confirm the successful creation and SSH access to your GCP VM.**  
- **Practice the quick exercises** around permissions, process monitoring, and memory checks.  
- Let me know once you’ve completed these tasks and what you observe. We’ll then move on to more **cloud-specific security features** (e.g., configuring firewall rules, exploring GCP’s Cloud Logging/Monitoring) and begin Phase 2: **Host Analysis and Malware Simulation**.

**Please report back** with any questions or difficulties you encounter—especially regarding file permissions, installing and using certain monitoring tools, or configuring GCP IAM roles. I’ll provide additional tips and resources, along with more tailored feedback, before we proceed to the next phase.
