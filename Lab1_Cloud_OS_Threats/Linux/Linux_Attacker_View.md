# Linux Attackers View - Cheat Sheet

## Linux Overview
### Philosophy (Attacker’s Perspective)
**Linux felxible Design Principles (everything is a file, chaining small tools, etc.) offer attackers a powerful toolkit.**

| **Principle**                                             | **Attacker’s Perspective**                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Everything is a file**                                  | Since configuration files and other critical data are stored in plain text, attackers can modify or replace these files to gain persistence, escalate privileges, or steal sensitive data.                                           |
| **Small, single-purpose programs**                        | Each tool can be combined (chained) to automate malicious tasks (e.g., quickly scanning, enumerating, and exfiltrating). Attackers love modular approaches because they can mix and match small tools for flexible exploitation flows.  |
| **Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks** | Attackers leverage shell scripting and piping to chain commands together. This can streamline data gathering or automate the process of planting and hiding backdoors, making the attack process more efficient.                         |
| **Avoid captive user interfaces**                         | The shell-based design allows attackers to remain “headless” and blend in with normal administrative workflows. They can script actions without a graphical interface, reducing their footprint and detection chances.                  |
| **Configuration data stored in a text file**             | Sensitive information (e.g., user accounts, cron jobs, or key application configs) is often in these files. Attackers can modify or inject malicious instructions (like cron-based reverse shells) with a simple text edit.             |

### Components (Attacker’s Perspective)
- **Components**: Each component, from the bootloader to system utilities, presents unique opportunities for **privilege escalation**, **persistence**, and **stealth**.

| **Component**      | **Attacker’s Perspective**                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bootloader**     | Manipulating the bootloader or its configuration can grant attackers early-stage control, allowing them to load malicious kernel modules or bypass security measures before the OS is fully operational.                 |
| **OS Kernel**      | The kernel is a prime target for privilege escalation: exploiting kernel vulnerabilities can grant an attacker root-level access. Once compromised at the kernel level, nearly all system activities are exposed.       |
| **Daemons**        | Daemons run in the background, often with high privileges. Attackers may replace or hijack these services to ensure persistent footholds or to execute malicious tasks unnoticed.                                      |
| **OS Shell**       | Command-line interfaces are ideal for stealth and automation. Attackers can run commands, pivot within the system, and script their actions to blend in with legitimate admin usage.                                   |
| **Graphics server**| Typically less of a direct target for console-based attackers, but vulnerabilities here can enable privilege escalation or allow remote graphical-based access for advanced attacks.                                   |
| **Window Manager** | Most attackers focus on shell access, but if they can compromise the GUI environment, they can capture keystrokes, user credentials, or manipulate the user’s session for further exploitation.                         |
| **Utilities**      | Common system tools (e.g., `sed`, `awk`, `curl`) can be hijacked or leveraged to download malicious payloads, parse data for exfiltration, or chain together tasks for complex attacks.                                |

### Linux Architecture (Attacker’s Perspective)
- **Architecture**: Exploiting lower-level layers (kernel, hardware) yields the greatest control. Meanwhile, higher-level layers (shell, utilities) offer attackers **automation** and **access** to everyday admin actions.
- An attacker’s interest in each directory is driven by the **potential impact** they can achieve—whether that’s **privilege escalation**, **persistence**, **data exfiltration**, or **stealthy communications**.
- Directories with **system-critical** files (like `/boot`, `/lib`, `/etc`) or **high-privilege executables** (like `/bin`, `/sbin`) are prime targets for attackers seeking **deep system control**.
- **World-writable** or **frequently ignored** locations (like `/tmp` or `/mnt`) are common places to **stage malicious tools** and files due to less scrutiny.


#### Architecture Layers Overview
| **Layer**          | **Attacker’s Perspective**                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hardware**       | Physical access to hardware (or the ability to control hardware peripherals) can allow attackers to implant keyloggers, tamper with disk contents, or intercept network communications.                            |
| **Kernel**         | Attacking the kernel is highly rewarding because kernel-level exploits let attackers bypass many security controls, gain root access, and maintain persistent stealth on the system.                               |
| **Shell**          | The CLI is an attacker’s playground—commands can be run silently, scripts can automate malicious tasks, and interactive shells allow real-time exploration and manipulation of the system.                         |
| **System Utility** | System utilities expose vital OS functionalities (e.g., package managers, cron schedulers). Attackers exploit these to install backdoors, exfiltrate data, or schedule malicious jobs under the guise of normal OS tasks. |




#### File System Hierarchy

| **Path**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                   | **Attacker’s Perspective**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`/`**        | The top-level directory is the root filesystem. It contains all files needed to boot the OS and serves as the mount point for other filesystems.                              | **Potential “pivot point”** for accessing other directories. Attackers might place rootkits here, modify critical startup scripts, or otherwise alter the root environment to gain persistent access or hide malicious activities.         |
| **`/bin`** | Contains essential command binaries used by the system for basic operations (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`).                                                                          | **Executable tampering** is a key risk. Attackers might replace or trojan system binaries to maintain stealthy access, escalate privileges, or run malicious code under legitimate process names.                                       |
| **`/boot`**| Consists of the static bootloader, kernel, and files required to boot the Linux OS.                                                                                           | **Kernel-level compromise**. If an attacker gains write access, they could insert malicious kernel modules or tamper with bootloader files to execute malicious code at startup, before most defenses load.                              |
| **`/dev`** | Contains device files to facilitate access to hardware devices.                                                                                                                | **Device manipulation or covert channels**. Attackers might create or hide behind pseudo-devices (e.g., `/dev/tcp`) to exfiltrate data or establish hidden communication channels.                                                       |
| **`/etc`** | Local system configuration files. Often includes user accounts (`/etc/passwd`), groups, and configurations for applications and services.                                      | **Configuration sabotage or credential theft**. Attackers may edit critical configs, add malicious cron jobs, or steal hashed credentials from files like `/etc/shadow`.                                                               |
| **`/home`**| Each user on the system has a subdirectory here for personal storage.                                                                                                          | **User data and staging**. Attackers target user files for exfiltration. They may also store malicious scripts in user directories that seem “normal” and go unnoticed for longer.                                                      |
| **`/lib`** | Shared library files required for system boot and application runtime.                                                                                                         | **Library hijacking**. Attackers could replace legitimate libraries with malicious ones (LD_PRELOAD attacks) to run unauthorized code whenever a program linked to that library is executed.                                            |
| **`/media`**| External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here.                                                                                                        | **Data exfiltration**. Attackers might leverage removable media to quickly steal data or introduce malware. They might also target auto-mounted drives to spread malicious files.                                                      |
| **`/mnt`** | Temporary mount point for regular filesystems, used to mount various filesystems or disk images.                                                                               | **Temporary staging area**. An attacker might mount hidden or encrypted filesystems here to store tools or stolen data. Because it’s a known “temporary” space, suspicious files often draw less attention.                              |
| **`/opt`** | Optional files such as third-party applications or tools are often installed here.                                                                                             | **Installation of custom tooling**. Attackers can place custom malware, backdoors, or reconnaissance tools in `/opt`, masking them as legitimate third-party or optional applications.                                                 |
| **`/root`**| The home directory for the `root` (superuser).                                                                                                                                | **High-value compromise**. Gaining write access here indicates root privileges. An attacker may store scripts, SSH keys, or other malicious binaries to maintain high-level persistence.                                               |
| **`/sbin`**| Contains executables used for system administration (binaries that generally require root privilege to run).                                                                   | **Privilege escalation**. Attackers with root access might replace administrative tools to escalate privileges or create backdoors. Malicious usage could remain hidden if they mimic legitimate system administration commands.       |
| **`/tmp`** | Used by the OS and applications to store temporary files. Typically cleared on reboot but may be emptied at other times.                                                       | **Common malware staging**. Because `/tmp` is world-writable, attackers frequently drop payloads or run scripts here. They can also exploit race conditions or symlink attacks if permissions aren’t properly secured.                  |
| **`/usr`** | Contains executables, libraries, man pages, etc., for system-wide applications and utilities.                                                                                  | **Extended system attack surface**. Attackers might replace or add binaries in subdirectories like `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` to execute malicious code that blends in with legitimate user-installed programs.                     |
| **`/var`** | Contains variable data like logs, mail, web files, and other dynamically modified content.                                                                                     | **Log manipulation and data exfiltration**. Attackers may clear or forge logs to hide tracks. They might place malicious content in web-accessible directories or manipulate spool files to escalate privileges or exfil data.           |

## System Information (Attacker’s Perspective)
- **System Information**: Attackers leverage knowledge of processes, users, and configurations to plan and escalate attacks.
- **Tools & Commands**: Almost any built-in command can be weaponized—from simple listing utilities (ls, cat) to network (curl, netstat) and package management (apt, pip).
- **By understanding legitimate functionality**, attackers can blend their actions with normal admin tasks, making detection harder.

| **Topic**                              | **Attacker’s Perspective**                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linux Structure**                    | Familiar file system and directory layout helps attackers quickly locate critical config files (e.g., `/etc/`, `/var/log/`) or binaries to modify for persistence.                                 |
| **Linux System Information**           | Gathering OS release, kernel version, and hardware details helps attackers find known vulnerabilities or tailor privilege-escalation exploits.                                                    |
| **Linux Processes**                    | Attackers can hide malicious processes among normal system processes, or target high-privilege processes (like daemons) to gain root access or persist in memory.                                 |
| **Linux Network Configuration**        | Reviewing IP addresses, routes, and interfaces helps attackers identify open ports/services, discover internal networks, and plan lateral movement.                                                |
| **Linux Users**                        | Enumerating users and groups reveals potential weak passwords, privileged accounts, or misconfigurations (e.g., sudoers file) that can be exploited to escalate privileges.                        |
| **Linux Directories**                  | Knowing default directories (e.g., `/home/`, `/usr/local/`, `/tmp/`) helps attackers find places to drop malware, store data, or hide tools where they may go unnoticed.                            |
| **Linux User Settings & Parameters**   | Attackers can manipulate environment variables and config files to set up persistent backdoors, harvest credentials, or intercept normal user operations without raising suspicion.              |

### Attacker View of The Shell (Command Line Interface)
**The shell is an attacker’s playground, he can use shell customization to display information about the system and the user.**
1. **Customizing Prompts**: Modify the prompt in .bashrc or the active shell for enhanced tracking:
`PS1='[\u@\h \w]\$ '`
2. **Operational Benefits**:
   - **Organization**: Track activities across multiple shells or hosts.
   - **Efficiency**: Navigate complex file systems quickly with visible context.
   - **Documentation**: Provide clear logs for compliance and reporting.


#### Attacker View Table: Bash Prompt for Penetration Testing

| **Prompt Component**          | **Description**                                                                 | **Attacker’s Perspective**                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<username>@<hostname><cwd>$` | Default Bash prompt for regular users.                                          | - Identify user and environment.<br>- Navigate file system efficiently using current directory display.         |
| `<username>@<hostname>[~]$`   | Indicates the user is in their home directory (`~`).                            | - Recognize home directory quickly for storing payloads or editing configuration files.                        |
| `<username>@<hostname><cwd>#` | Default Bash prompt for root users.                                             | - Confirms root access.<br>- Enables execution of privileged commands without restrictions.                    |
| `$`                           | Minimal prompt for unprivileged users.                                          | - Often seen in restricted shells.<br>- Indicates lack of privilege escalation.                                |
| `#`                           | Minimal prompt for root or privileged users.                                    | - Confirms privilege escalation success.<br>- Enables execution of high-privileged tasks.                      |

#### **Special Prompt Variables**: Customization and Attacker Usage

| **Special Character** | **Description**                                  | **Attacker’s Perspective**                                                                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `\u`                  | Current username.                               | - Useful for identifying user context after pivoting or privilege escalation.                                  |
| `\h`                  | Short hostname of the system.                   | - Helps confirm the target environment in multi-host operations.                                               |
| `\H`                  | Full hostname of the system.                    | - Provides detailed host information for documentation or targeting.                                           |
| `\w`                  | Full path of the current working directory.     | - Facilitates efficient navigation and identification of sensitive directories.                                |
| `\d`                  | Displays the current date (e.g., Mon Feb 6).    | - Timestamp logs or commands during operations for auditing or stealth.                                        |
| `\D{%Y-%m-%d}`        | Date in custom format (e.g., 2025-01-12).       | - Standardized date format for aligning with external reports or logs.                                         |

## Workflow
- **Hidden File Discovery**: Use `ls -la` to find configuration files or credentials hidden with a dot prefix.
- **Target Permissions**: Analyze `ls -l` output to spot world-writable directories (`drwxrwxrwx`) or files owned by privileged users.
- **Temporary Files**: Inspect `/dev/shm` or `/tmp` using `ls -la` for potential leftover files or active processes.
- **File Search**: Use `find` to locate files based on attributes like size, owner, or type.
- **File Search**: Use `locate` to quickly search for files using a prebuilt database, enabling faster but less granular searches compared to find.
- **File Search**: Use `updatedb` to update the `locate` command’s database with the latest file and directory changes.
- **File Search**: Use `which` to show the path to an executable binary.

## System Management

### User Management
User management is a core aspect of Linux system administration, encompassing tasks such as creating and managing users, assigning group memberships, and controlling user access.
For attackers, these capabilities enable reconnaissance of user accounts, privilege escalation, and persistence. Manipulating user accounts or groups can provide access to sensitive files and directories or create backdoors for continued access.
- **Core Functionality**: User management in Linux involves creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts, managing group memberships, and controlling user access.
- **Execution Context**: Commands like sudo and su allow users to execute commands as other users, including root, enabling attackers to escalate privileges or access sensitive files.
- **File and Directory Permissions**: User and group memberships determine access to files and directories, making user management essential for privilege escalation and lateral movement.
- **Importance for Attackers**: Misconfigurations or weak passwords can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, create backdoor accounts, or modify existing accounts for persistence.


### Package Management
- **Core Functionality**: Package management in Linux involves installing, updating, and removing software packages, along with managing their dependencies.  
- **Execution Context**: Tools like `apt`, `dpkg`, and `snap` handle package operations, ensuring consistent installations and efficient updates.  
- **Dependency Resolution**: Package managers automate the resolution of dependencies, retrieving required libraries or binaries during installation.  
- **Importance for Attackers**: Attackers leverage package managers to install tools, maintain persistence, and exploit vulnerable packages. Misconfigurations or outdated packages are often targeted for exploitation.  

### Practical Exercise: Evil-WinRM Installation

**Objective**: Search for the "evil-winrm" tool on GitHub and install it using various methods to simulate real-world deployment scenarios.  

#### Steps:
1. **Using `git`**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm.git ~/tools/evil-winrm
   ```
   - Clone the Evil-WinRM repository into a tools directory for post-exploitation or remote access to Windows systems.

2. **Using `wget`**:
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm/archive/refs/heads/master.zip -O evil-winrm.zip
   unzip evil-winrm.zip -d ~/tools/
   ```
   - Download the Evil-WinRM archive and extract it for usage.

3. **Manual Installation**:
   - Download the necessary dependencies and configure Evil-WinRM for your target environment.
   - Install dependencies using `gem install winrm winrm-fs`.

### Service and Process Management - Short Description

- **Core Functionality**: Service and process management is a fundamental aspect of Linux administration, involving the monitoring, starting, stopping, and restarting of services and processes.
- **Services (Daemons)**: Background programs, often ending in `d` (e.g., `sshd`), that perform system tasks or provide services without user interaction.
- **Processes**: Active programs that can be managed using signals or commands to control their behavior (e.g., running, stopping, or killing them).
- **Tools and Techniques**: Tools like `systemctl`, `ps`, `kill`, and `journalctl` help administrators and attackers manage services and processes effectively.
- **Importance for Attackers**: Attackers leverage service and process management for persistence (starting malicious services), evasion (killing monitoring processes), and exploration (identifying running services for exploitation).


### Task Scheduling:
- **Core Functionality**: Task scheduling in Linux automates repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency and efficiency without manual intervention.  
- **Execution Tools**: Tools like `systemd` and `cron` allow administrators to schedule tasks based on time intervals or specific events.  
- **Key Use Cases**: Tasks include software updates, database maintenance, backups, and executing scripts at defined intervals.  
- **Importance for Attackers**: Misconfigured or overly permissive scheduling systems can be exploited to execute malicious scripts, maintain persistence, or disrupt critical services.  

### Network Services
- **Core Importance**: Network services in Linux are fundamental for enabling communication between systems, transferring files, managing remote systems, and hosting applications.  
- **Service Interaction**: Knowledge of network services such as SSH, NFS, web servers, and VPNs is crucial for system administrators and penetration testers to manage and secure systems effectively or identify vulnerabilities.  
- **Penetration Testing**: Attackers exploit misconfigured or outdated network services to gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate data, or escalate privileges.


### Backup and Restore 
- **Core Functionality**: Linux systems provide robust tools for backing up and restoring data, ensuring data protection, encryption, and ease of recovery.  
- **Tools**: Utilities like `rsync`, `Deja Dup`, and `Duplicity` support local and remote backups, with features like compression, incremental backups, and encryption for secure data transfer.  
- **Secure Transfers**: Combining tools like `rsync` with SSH ensures encrypted data transfers, safeguarding sensitive information during backups.  
- **Automation**: Tools like `cron` enable automated synchronization, ensuring regular and consistent backups with minimal manual intervention.  
- **Importance for Attackers**: Exploiting backup misconfigurations can provide access to sensitive data or backup systems themselves. Automated scripts and credentials in backup processes are often key targets.


### File System Management 

- **Core Functionality**: File system management in Linux involves organizing and maintaining data across storage devices, supporting various file systems like `ext4`, `XFS`, `NTFS`, and more.  
- **Execution Context**: Tasks include partitioning, formatting, mounting, and unmounting file systems, along with managing permissions and inodes for files and directories.  
- **Disk and Swap Management**: Disk partitions are managed using tools like `fdisk` or `gparted`, while swap space ensures smooth performance by offloading inactive memory pages.  
- **Importance for Attackers**: Misconfigured mounts, insecure file permissions, or unused swap areas can provide opportunities for privilege escalation, persistence, or exfiltration.  

#### Additional Attacker Scenarios:
1. **Analyze Mounted Drives**: Use `mount` or `cat /etc/fstab` to identify writable partitions for storing malicious files.
2. **Manipulate Swap Space**: Exploit sensitive data stored in unencrypted swap areas.
3. **Bypass Permissions**: Use inode numbers from `ls -il` to reference hidden or inaccessible files directly.
4. **Persistence**: Add custom mount entries to `/etc/fstab` for persistent access to drives.
