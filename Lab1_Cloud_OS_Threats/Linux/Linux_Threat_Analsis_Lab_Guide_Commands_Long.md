Based on your uploaded documents, I will create a tailored Linux knowledge-testing plan focused on OS internals and host-based threat analysis. This will prepare you for the **Palo Alto Networks XDR** interview while aligning with Meta’s requirements for detection engineering. Here’s the plan:

---

### **Full Linux Knowledge Test Plan**
#### **1. Linux OS Internals**
Focus: Core concepts including processes, memory management, file systems, and networking.
##### Key Topics:
1. **Processes**: Creation, scheduling, signals, and privilege escalation techniques.
2. **Memory Management**: Virtual memory, shared memory, memory leaks, and swapping.
3. **File Systems**: Permissions, symbolic vs. hard links, SUID/SGID, and special files (`/dev`, `/proc`).
4. **Networking**: TCP/IP stack, tools like `netstat`, `ss`, and packet analysis with `tcpdump`.

##### Test Questions:
- Explain the difference between user and kernel space in Linux.
- What are zombie processes? How would you identify and handle them?
- Describe the purpose of the `/proc` directory.
- How do attackers use SUID files to escalate privileges? How can these be detected?

##### Practical Tasks:
- List all processes consuming the highest CPU and memory (`top`, `ps aux`).
- Simulate a zombie process and clean it up using `kill`.
- Inspect the routing table using `ip route` and identify potential misconfigurations.
- Set a SUID on a test script and detect it using `find` (`find / -perm -4000`).

#### **2. Host-Based Threat Analysis**
Focus: Identify and analyze internal threats using system tools and logs.
##### Key Topics:
1. **Logs Analysis**: Understanding `syslog`, `auth.log`, and kernel logs.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: Techniques like exploiting sudo, SUID binaries.
3. **File System Exploits**: Hidden files, permissions, and configuration vulnerabilities.

##### Test Questions:
- How would you analyze a sudden spike in disk usage? 
- Describe a methodology to detect unauthorized privilege escalation.
- How do attackers exploit `/tmp` and `/dev/shm`? How would you monitor these?

##### Practical Tasks:
- Search for anomalies in `/var/log/auth.log` (e.g., failed login attempts).
- Identify world-writable files (`find / -type f -perm 777`).
- Simulate a hidden process by launching one in `/dev/shm` and detect it.
- Create a custom cron job for persistence and identify it using `journalctl`.

---

#### **3. Cloud-Specific Lab Challenges**
Focus: Extend Linux internals knowledge to the cloud environment.
##### Tasks:
1. **Simulate an Attack**:
   - Create a malicious SUID binary and test its detection using custom scripts.
   - Simulate data exfiltration via a temporary file in `/tmp` and detect it.
2. **Threat Detection**:
   - Use logs from the VM instance (e.g., GCP logs) to trace suspicious SSH connections.
   - Simulate and mitigate privilege escalation by exploiting misconfigured sudoers files.

##### Questions:
- What additional precautions are necessary for Linux VMs in the cloud compared to on-prem systems?
- How would you integrate detection mechanisms for `/dev/shm` usage in a cloud logging pipeline?

---

#### **4. Advanced Linux Scripting Challenges**
Focus: Python and Bash scripting for automation.
##### Tasks:
- Write a Python script to parse and summarize failed SSH login attempts from `/var/log/auth.log`.
- Create a Bash script to monitor file changes in `/etc/` and `/var/`.
- Automate detection of SUID binaries and notify administrators.

##### Questions:
- Explain how you would optimize log parsing in Python for large files.
- What are the security implications of using symbolic links in temporary directories?

---

### **Expected Deliverables**
- Comprehensive understanding of Linux OS internals and security nuances.
- Practical experience detecting and mitigating host-based threats.
- Clear articulation of strategies for detecting cloud-hosted attacks.
- Confidence in discussing logs, file systems, and network-level anomalies.
