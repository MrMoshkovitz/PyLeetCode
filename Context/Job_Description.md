# Official Company Interview Preparation Email

Hey Gal\!

It was lovely speaking with you earlier :)

As discussed, we'd love to book your first interviews for the Security Engineer \- Surface Coverage, Detection Engineering (Tel Aviv)role \- job spec [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.metacareers.com%2Fjobs%2F1848473012229480%2F&h=AT0Iyg8HZmTx0QJqLGKX-YOW9EDqxr5BaUB0aaW4-m26F7OLA8TwKgB3ZAGP-GWE_tBm54uCaJz-cwdX55ikirEqzuI83iXfws72rkEcHaw6h7RfNclVOSOvqyZmyv1Q5sUA_8DET679-o4Fz814LU8Wr7DESKUj_CSPWP4dILQ).

You will meet with members of the team across two separate 45-min meetings. One meeting will be covering technical security questions and the second meeting will be a live coding exercise.

Below, I’m providing the high-level touch points that you will encounter throughout the interviews, and some key focus areas to derive examples from.

**Top tips to remember throughout the interview:**

\- Throughout the interview, it is very important to always consider different use cases, talk through your thoughts and have a conversation with the interviewer. \- Always ask clarifying questions: we’re built on collaboration and it’s important to cover the scenario before answering.  
\- Providing examples are some of the best ways to dive into specific questions and show real life experience.

You will be asked 2 questions that are general security / detection engineering focussed, so good to prepare on detection concepts. One question will be more scenario based, for example how you would approach an incident situation.

These topics might be good to refresh on as well as part of the conversation:

\-Host Analysis: be prepared to talk through host-based situations and how to tackle them in both internal and external threat situations.  
\-Network-based situations may apply, but focus on endpoint detections.  
\-Attack Knowledge  
\-Detection Techniques: think about various situations where you had to deal with either internal or external attacks, and the measures you used or improved upon to prevent this in the future.  
\-Incident Response Procedure: what does a typical investigation process look like for you from start to finish?  
\-Understanding of logs, the importance of procedure and how you tackle different situations.  
\-Forensic Knowledge

**Scripting**:  
The second interview will be focused on your ability to create scripts from scratch.  
While we do provide coding preparation, keep in mind that we are not looking for production level code, but more fundamental scripting knowledge focused on syntax, basic script construction and evaluating different use cases.

In terms of what to expect in the scripting interview \- we are looking for the ability to solve a problem with a real, working solution

* understand the time and space requirement of the program, algorithm and data structures you use to solve the problem.  
* explain the time-memory trade offs of different approaches.  
* practice coding with Arrays and iterating over Arrays with indices.  
* practice coding using data structures like Sets, Lists and Maps. Understand when to use each and why.

In all situations, it’s advisable to talk through your code. It’s important for us to understand your train of thought and understand the decisions you make throughout the interview.  
Be sure to understand other possible solutions and potential errors in your own code.

We advise practicing with problems from [www.leetcode.com.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.leetcode.com%2F&h=AT38gGy-MF1a3rh_ngJ89Oq2bby2imak3xNN47-iUQBekXh6FoRc4KWZi2vSVayb5LUSHXX0k9qlNaHo7jfNVz7LLB1yQoRvOWBtlVXKAUoTbIEsqVJUKntHqPliJFWP54Zv9cdHRgffhNoQssxxXmOSE6jhKiWfXnOCNW_8UrI) If you are able to complete a few easy questions (10-15 min) and a few medium-hard questions (15-20 min) on your own, you should be positioned to do well. When we talk about practicing, it does not mean just reviewing the prompt and solution to see if you understand the concepts. We suggest actually taking time in solving the problem and talking about your steps/logic out loud to get you accustomed to the environment of an interview. These exercises are relevant to the questions you will see during these interviews.
