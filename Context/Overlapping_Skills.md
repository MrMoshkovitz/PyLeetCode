# Overlapping Skills Between Palo Alto & Meta

"""
The new Palo Alto–focused files highlight the same core security competencies (endpoint/network detection, threat research, coding, and incident response) that Meta also values. By sharpening your abilities in OS internals, TTP-based detection, machine learning, and Python/SQL for Palo Alto, you’re simultaneously building the technical depth and detection engineering expertise required for the MetaXDR role.
