Focus On:
- Detection Engineering 
    - Threat Hunting
        - MITRE ATT&CK tactics/techniques through TTP-based detection
    - Threat Modeling
        - TTP-based Threat Modeling
    - Design Detection Logic from vaious log sources (Host-based, Network-based, etc.)
    - Leveraging Penetration Testing to Strengthen Detection Capabilities 

- Incident Response
    - False Positive Reduction strategies and Auto Resolving Workflows
    - Advanced Threat Detection Logic, and Correlation Strategies
    - Leveraging Penetration Testing to Strengthen Incident Response Workflows
    - Incident Response Scenarios
        - Use structured thinking: Identification --> Containment --> Eradication --> Recovery --> Lessons Learned.
        - Provide a real example of when you discovered a critical misconfiguration and how you orchestrated the fix.
- Programming:
    - Building/Improving Security Tooling in Large-Scale Environments
    - Designing Large-Scale Log Pipelines
    - Python:
        - Common data structures - Practice coding and understanding when, why, and how to use each and explaining your choices.
            - Focus Areas:
                - Strings
                - Arrays
                - Maps
                - Sets
                - Graph/Tree traversals (since your exposure graph experience might come up).
        - LeetCode Strategy:
            - Start with Easy to build speed (10–15 min solutions).
            - Move to Medium (15–20 min solutions), focusing on problem-solving steps out loud.
            - Explain Big-O complexity clearly when coding:
                - For instance, if you use a dictionary (hash map), mention average O(1) insertion/lookup.
                - If you use a list, mention O(n) for insertion/lookup.
            - Problem-solving patterns (Common Data Structures)
            - Explain time-memory trade-offs of different approaches.
            - Practice coding with Arrays and iterating over Arrays with indices.
        - Potential Code Errors Understanding - Explain why the code might fail.
        - Other Possible Solutions to the Problem - Explain why they are not as good as the one you chose.
        - ‘Talk-Aloud’ Method - Explain your logic while coding.






## Final Recommendations
- Strengthen Your Detection Engineering Narrative
    - Articulate your approach to log analysis, correlation, and intrusion detection at scale.
    - Emphasize your knowledge of TTP-based frameworks and demonstrate how you integrate them into day-to-day detection strategies.
- Refine Coding Interview Mechanics
    - Focus on LeetCode style problems involving arrays, strings, and hash maps.
    - Practice explaining your approach, including complexity analysis, out loud.
- Combine Offensive and Defensive Perspectives
    - Showcase the synergy between your penetration testing background and incident response/detection knowledge.
    - Emphasize how your offensive expertise helps you build stronger defensive controls and detection mechanisms.
