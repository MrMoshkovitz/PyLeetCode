## 3. **Non-Technical Skills & Interview Strategies**

1. **Behavioral & Project Ownership**
   - Prepare **STAR** stories (Situation, Task, Action, Result) showcasing:  
     - **Independent research** to detect advanced threats.  
     - **Collaboration** with cross-functional teams.  
     - **Driving end-to-end** security initiatives (e.g., building an internal tool from scratch).  
   - Emphasize **quantifiable results** (e.g., detection coverage improvements, reduction in false positives).

2. **Case Studies & Scenario-Based Questions**
   - **Palo Alto**: Might ask for a deep dive into how you’d detect a specific APT technique or handle malware with new evasion tactics.

## 7. **Next Steps & Clarification**

- If you need **specific** examples of **malware analysis** or advanced detection workflows you’ve conducted, let me know, and we can tailor your **STAR** stories.  
- If you feel you need more hands-on with **machine learning** or **data science** approaches, we can outline a mini project to demonstrate your knowledge.  

By focusing on these **core areas**—OS and network internals, threat intelligence, Python & SQL proficiency, and strong project leadership examples—you’ll be well-prepared for **Palo Alto’s** technical and behavioral questions. Simultaneously, you’ll develop and refine the **detection engineering** and **incident response** skills that translate directly into success for a **Meta** interview. Good luck on both processes!
