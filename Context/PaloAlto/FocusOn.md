Focus On:

1. Threat Detection & Research
   - **APT Methodologies**: Deepen knowledge of modern attacker TTPs and how to detect them.
   - **Malware Analysis**: Setting up lab simulations and reversing malware behavior.

2. Network & Endpoint Expertise
   - **Protocol Mastery**: Study Kerberos, RPC, SMB, DNS, HTTP, etc. from an attacker/defender perspective.
   - **OS Internals**: Windows and Linux deep dives (process creation, memory management, file system).

3. Machine Learning & Data Analysis (Optional for Extra Edge)
   - **Algorithmic Basics**: Supervised vs. unsupervised, clustering, anomaly detection.
   - **Data-Driven Threat Detection**: Using large datasets to identify subtle attack patterns.

4. Python & SQL Proficiency
   - **Scripting from scratch**: Automating threat detection tasks, log analysis, and data correlation.
   - **SQL**: Constructing advanced queries (JOINs, GROUP BY, indexing) for threat intelligence.

5. Enterprise Infrastructure & Cloud Security
   - **Active Directory** & **Security Products**: Understand common enterprise setups and potential attack vectors.
   - **Cloud** (AWS, Azure, GCP) for extended detection coverage and architecture considerations.

6. Project Ownership & Team Collaboration
   - Highlight **independent research** contributions and cross-functional teamwork.
   - Demonstrate how you coordinate with diverse teams and communicate findings effectively.


"""
The new Palo Alto–focused files highlight the same core security competencies (endpoint/network detection, threat research, coding, and incident response) that Meta also values. By sharpening your abilities in OS internals, TTP-based detection, machine learning, and Python/SQL for Palo Alto, you’re simultaneously building the technical depth and detection engineering expertise required for the MetaXDR role.
