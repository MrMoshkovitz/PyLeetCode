## Comprehensive Course Book: Phase 1 - Introduction to Attacker Methodologies and TTPs

---

### **1. General Understanding**

#### **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**
- **Structure**: Organized into tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that outline the various stages of an attack lifecycle.
  - **Tactics**: High-level attack objectives (e.g., Initial Access, Execution, Persistence).
  - **Techniques**: Methods used to achieve tactics (e.g., Credential Dumping, Lateral Movement).
  - **Procedures**: Specific implementations of techniques by threat actors.
- **Purpose**:
  - Enables defenders to understand, track, and mitigate attacker behavior.
  - Provides a shared language for discussing and researching threats.
  - Guides security operations in developing robust detection and prevention strategies.

#### **Key Attacker Goals**
1. **Credential Theft**:
   - Access to privileged systems.
   - Techniques: Keylogging, credential dumping.
2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Gaining higher access within a system.
   - Techniques: Exploiting vulnerabilities, bypassing User Account Control (UAC).
3. **Lateral Movement**:
   - Spreading across systems to expand control.
   - Techniques: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Pass-the-Hash.
4. **Data Exfiltration**:
   - Stealing sensitive information.
   - Techniques: Encrypted channels, cloud services abuse.

#### **Real-World Case Studies**
1. **APT29 (Cozy Bear)**:
   - Target: Government and private organizations.
   - TTPs:
     - Initial Access: Spear phishing.
     - Persistence: Malware implants.
     - Lateral Movement: Credential theft and RDP.
   - Lessons Learned:
     - Importance of email filtering and multifactor authentication.
2. **FIN7**:
   - Target: Financial sector.
   - TTPs:
     - Social engineering to deploy malware.
     - Data theft through point-of-sale systems.
   - Lessons Learned:
     - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions are critical.

### **2. Technical Questions**

#### **Conceptual Questions**
1. How does the MITRE ATT&CK framework assist in identifying attacker TTPs?
2. What are the benefits of mapping real-world attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK framework?
3. How can organizations leverage ATT&CK to improve incident response?

#### **Scenario-Based Questions**
1. Describe a typical APT attack lifecycle. Map it to a real-world case study.
2. How do attackers leverage lateral movement techniques to achieve their goals?
3. Given a set of endpoint logs, identify potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).

#### **Practice Questions**
1. Multiple Choice:
   - Which of the following is an example of lateral movement? (A) Credential Dumping, (B) RDP, (C) Keylogging, (D) Spear Phishing
2. Short Answer:
   - Define the difference between tactics and techniques in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
3. Essay:
   - Explain how advanced threat actors use social engineering to gain initial access and how defenders can mitigate this.

### **3. Hands-On Tasks**

#### **Mapping an APT Campaign to MITRE ATT&CK**
- **Objective**: Analyze the APT29 campaign and map its TTPs to the framework.
- **Steps**:
  1. Research APT29’s known attack patterns.
  2. Map each observed technique to a corresponding ATT&CK tactic.
  3. Document findings in a structured table.

#### **Threat Intelligence Analysis**
- **Objective**: Summarize the TTPs from threat intelligence blogs.
- **Resources**:
  - Mandiant reports.
  - CrowdStrike blogs.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify key attacker methods.
  2. Cross-reference with MITRE ATT&CK.
  3. Write a short report highlighting detection points.

#### **Simulated Attack Chain in a Lab**
- **Objective**: Simulate and analyze an attack chain.
- **Tools**: Metasploit, ATT&CK Navigator.
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up a virtualized lab environment.
  2. Simulate initial access, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
  3. Monitor and document detection opportunities.
